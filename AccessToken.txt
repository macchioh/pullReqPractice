Since Aug 2021, Github no longer uses user passwords to validate remote pushes.  

You now need to use a personal access token.  A token can be generated on Github's site under
'Developer Settings'.  Then when setting up the remote on the CLI, use this url:

https://<TOKEN>@github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPONAME>.github

git add remote origin <url>
