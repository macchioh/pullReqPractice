The best practice workflow seems to be:
1. fork a repo of interest on github.  This will clone the repo on your github with 
reference to your username.  
2. copy the repo link to clone the repo on your local machine.  
2.5.  suppose you could copy the link to clone the original repo and then make a github repo
and push to there?
3. make any branches/changes and push to github repo.  
4. from there can make a pull request to the original repo / admin.
